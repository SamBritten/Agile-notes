Agile Manifesto - 2001:

	Individuals and interaction over processes and tools.
	Working software over comprehensive documantation.
	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
	Responding to change over following a plan.

12 agile principles.



Scrum Framework:

Product Backlog > Sprint Backlog > 2-4 weeks (24 hours) > Potentially shippable product increment.

Scrum Elements:
 Events:
   Sprint
   Sprint planning meeting.
   Sprint review meeting.
   Sprint retrospective meeting.
   Daily Scrum.

Sprint:
 Time-based period of software development.
 Container for other events.
 One week to one month duration.
 Always produces a potentially shippable product increment.

Sprint Planning Meeting:
 For scrum team to plan the sprint delivery.
 Timeboxed to eight hours for a one month sprint.
 Split into two parts: 'What' and 'How'.
 Attendees: Product Owner
	    Scrum Master
	    Development Team

Sprint Review Meeting:
 Informal event held at the end of every sprint.
 Four hour timebox for a one month sprint.
 Attendees: Scrum Team
	    Stakeholders invited by product owner
 Output: revised product backlog.

Sprint Retrospective Meeting:
 Facilitated by scrum master to discuss:
	What went right.
	What went wrong.
	What we could change.
	Actions to be assigned.
 Everyone should get the chance to air their views - (Open, Honest, Constructive).



Daily Scrum:
 Daily inspection and adaption event for the development team.
 Scrum master ensures daily scrum occurs.
 Same time, same place.
 <15 minutes.
 Often called a 'stand-up'.

Scrum Artefacts:
 Product backlog.
 Sprint backlog.
 Increment.

Artefact - Product Backlog:
 Ordered list of everythig that might be needed in the product.
 Owned by product owner.
 Refined by scrum team.
 Developed by development team.
 Can be on cards or held on computer, but visible to all.
 Understandable to all Stakeholders.
 Detailed appropriately, Estimated, Emergent, Prioritise - (DEEP).

Artefact - Sprint Backlog;
 List of tasks committed to be completed in the current sprint or iteration.
 Team decides on the items and the time to complete them.
 User stories are broken down into tasks.
 	As a <user>, I want <feature>, so that <explanation>.
 Any team member can pick from tasks.
 Property of the team.
 Shown on the task board for all to see.

Artefact - Increment:
 'Sum of the product backlog items completed during a sprint and the value of the increments of  	all previous sprints' - Scrum Guide.
 


Role - Scrum Master:
 Ensures the scrum process is followed and understod.
 Removes impediments to enable the development team to be fully functional and productive.
 No formal technical training.

Role - Product Owner:
 Owns the product backlog.
 Defines the product backlog items.
 Responsible for profitbilty - ROI.
 Prioritises/orders backlog items.
 Provides vision and boundaries.

Role - Developer (Development Team):
 Cross-functional - 3 to 9 people.
 Organises itself and its work.
 Dedicated.
 
Scrum Values:
 Courage.
 Focus.
 Commitment.
 Respect.
 Openness.

Monitoring Progress:
 measurement is for the development team.
 Determine progress in the sprint.
 Indicator of team performance.
 Many techniques.

velocity:
 This is the amount of work the team is able to get done in one sprint.
 Bases on experience from previous sprints (estimated for first few sprnts).
 Can be measures in:
	Ideal days.
	Story points.
 Helps improve estimation over length of project.

Velocity is NOT capability.

Capacity:
 team size.
 Sprint length.
 Abscence. 

Capability:
 Know-how.
 Impediments.

Burndown Chart:
 Daily feedback chart visible for all to see.
 Information radiatior.
 Measured in story points. 	
 
Definition of Done.

Definition of Ready.

M - Must be included in next sprint.
S - Should be included in next sprint.
C - Could be included in next sprint.
W - Won't be included in next sprint.
